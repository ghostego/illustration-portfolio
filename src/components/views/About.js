          He meant to write you, but was delayed. Meanwhile, he sent me most of
          the magazines with your articles, and I saw at once, from your
          drawings and descriptions, that my stones are certainly the kind you
          mean. You can appreciate this from the enclosed prints. Later on you
          will hear directly from Dr. Boyle. Now I can understand how important
          all this will be to you. Without question we are faced with the
          remains of an unknown civilization older than any dreamed of before,
          and forming a basis for your legends. As a mining engineer, I have
          some knowledge of geology, and can tell you that these blocks are so
          ancient they frighten me. They are mostly sandstone and granite,
          though one is almost certainly made of a queer sort of cement or
          concrete. They bear evidence of water action, as if this part of the
          world had been submerged and come up again after long ages—all since
          those blocks were made and used. It is a matter of hundreds of
          thousands of years—or heaven knows how much more. I don't like to
          think about it. In view of your previous diligent work in tracking
          down the legends and everything connected with them, I cannot doubt
          but that you will want to lead an expedition to the desert and make
          some archaeological excavations. Both Dr. Boyle and I are prepared to
          cooperate in such work if you—or organizations known to you—can
          furnish the funds.
